# Clustering-of-Faces
Overview
This project leverages the face_recognition library to implement a K-Means clustering algorithm aimed at grouping faces of famous celebrities. By utilizing advanced facial recognition techniques, the project efficiently clusters celebrity images based on their facial features.

Key Features
1. Face Detection and Encoding: Uses the face_recognition library to detect and encode faces from images.
2. K-Means Clustering: Applies the K-Means algorithm to group similar faces, identifying clusters that represent different celebrities.
3. Scalable and Efficient: Designed to handle a large number of images and accurately cluster them with minimal computational overhead.
